Metadata means information.
DatabaseMetadata 
It is an Interface available in java.sql package.
Implementation of DatabaseMetadata(I) is provided by driver vendor 
It is used to get information about your database.



ResultSetMetaData
It is an Interface available in java.sql package.
Implementation of ResultSetMetaData(I) is provided by driver vendor
It is used to get information about ResultSet object(table name ,column name,column type etc....)

RowSet
It is an Interface available in javax.sql package.
RowSet Interface extends ResultSet interface .


Question:ResultSet And RowSet ?
ResultSet object is used to store records return by select sql statement .
RowSet object is also used to store records return by select sql statement .
ResultSet object can be create as below: 
Connection con = JDBCUtil.getMySQLConnection();
		Statement st = con.createStatement();
		String sql="select * from student";
		ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(sql);
RowSet object can be create as below:
To do 
By default ResultSet are forward only and read only.
By default RowSet are scrollable and updatable.
ResultSet objects are not eligible for serialization.
RowSet objects are eligible for serialization.
ResultSet object is connection oriented .
RowSet is connectionless object.


Batch Updates:
When you multiple queries to database one by one then lot of time will be wasted for request and response
ex-using statement
for one sql statement=request time(5 MS) rt + complie time(5MS) + execution time(5MS) + response time (5 MS)=20MS total time.
for 100 sql statement = 100*20=(2000 MS)
using update statement 
for one sql statement = 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 =15MS
for 100 sql statements = 100*15=1500MS

In the above two cases you are trying to submit 100 sql statements. For submitting 100 sql statements, you need to comunicate database 100
times. This increases number round trips b/w your application and database. Which damage the application performance.

Batch updates allow you to submit multiple sql statements to the database at a time
For 100 sql statements =(5MS+100*5+100*5+5)=1010 MS

Note:
You can use UID (Update/Insert/Delete) query only. 
You cann't use select query.
