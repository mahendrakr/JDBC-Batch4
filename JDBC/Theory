7 Steps of JDBC-
Step1 : Load the driver class.
Step2 : Establish the connection .
Step3 : Prepare the SQL statement.
Step4 : Create JDBC statement .
Step5 : Submit the SQL statement to database using JDBC statement.
Step6 : Process the result .
Step7 : Close all the resources.

Diff. b/w Statement and PreparedStatement :
1. In Statement place holder concept is not available but in PreparedStatement place holder
	concept is available means you can pass dynamic value
2. Statement is not secure but PReparedStatement is more secured.
3. Performance of Statement is poor compared to PreparedStatement.

ResultSet : it is an interface available in java.sql package which contains the record return by select statement.
suppose object of statement is st :
ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery(sql_statement);
Types of ResultSet :
A. Depending on the ResultSet cursor movement, you can divide the ResultSet into 2 types,
1. Forward only
2. Scrollable
Forward only : when ResultSet is forward only then, 
* pointer can be moved in the forward direction only.
* pointer can be moved only once.
* pointer can be moved in sequential order only.
* by default ResultSet is forward only
How can you explicitly define the ResultSet as forward only?
st = con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY);

Scrollable : 
* Pointer can be moved in both forward and backward direction.
* Pointer can be moved multiple time.
* Pointer can be moved in random order.
How can you explicitly define the ResultSet as scrollable?
st = con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE);

note: scrollable are of two types TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
B. Depending on the ResultSet updation, you can divide the ResultSet into two types:
1-> read only
2-> updatable ResultSet/Dynamic ResultSet
READ ONLY : 
1-- when ResultSet is read only then ypu can just access the data from ResultSet object by galling the getter method
	and you can not do any updations on the ResultSet object.
2-- By default ResultSets are Read only.
How can you explicitly define the ResultSet Read only?
st = con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
Updatable ResultSet : when resultset is updatable, you can do following operation:
1--Access the data from resultset.
2--Insert record into the ResultSet,udate the records, delete the records from ResultSet.
3--When ResultSet is updatable then it must be scrollable.
How can you explicitly define the ResultSet updatable?
st = con.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

NOTE: ResultSet will not become updatable even when you use ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE in the following cases:
1-> when select statement uses joins.
2-> when select statement uses aggregate function.
3-> when select statement uses * instead of column names (in oracle,Mysql).
